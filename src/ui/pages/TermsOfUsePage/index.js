                <h5> 5. THE YUGDEX WALLET (OFFERED AND OPERATED BY BINANCE).  </h5>
                
                <p> <strong> 5.1 Supported Cryptocurrencies. </strong> The Yugdex wallet allows you to send, receive and store cryptocurrency (together, “Wallet Transactions”). The Yugdex wallet is only available in relation to the cryptocurrencies that Yugdex, in its sole discretion, decides to support (“Supported Cryptocurrency” or “Supported Cryptocurrencies”). Information about the Supported Cryptocurrencies can be found on the FAQ page on the Yugdex website. The Supported Cryptocurrencies may change from time to time. Under no circumstances should you attempt to carry out a Yugdex wallet Transaction in relation to a cryptocurrency other than a Supported Cryptocurrency. 
                </p>
                <p> <strong> 5.2 Transaction instructions.  </strong> Yugdex will process Wallet Transactions according to your instructions. You accept and agree that Yugdex does not: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(a) guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, or other party to a Yugdex Wallet Transaction. You are solely responsible for ensuring all transaction details are correct, and you should carefully verify all transaction information prior to submitting transaction instructions to Yugdex; or 
                    </li>

                        (b) have any control over, or any liability in relation to, the delivery, quality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may buy from or sell to any third party.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p> <strong> 5.3 Receiving cryptocurrency.  </strong> You may receive Supported Cryptocurrency into your Yugdex wallet by providing the sender with a receive address generated in your Yugdex wallet. Your Yugdex wallet will only be credited with Supported Cryptocurrency sent to a receive address generated through your Yugdex wallet and associated with that Supported Cryptocurrency. For example, your Yugdex wallet will be credited with ETH when it is sent to an ETH receive address generated through your Yugdex wallet. 
                </p>
                <p> <strong> 5.4 Fiat Currency P2P transactions. </strong>  Yugdex allows you to use fiat currency funds solely in exchange for certain Supported Cryptocurrencies (like USDT) and with other Yugdex Users in so-called “P2P transactions.” In a P2P transaction, Yugdex holds the digital currency in escrow between the two counterparties until payment in fiat currency funds between the buyer and seller Users has been confirmed. Such Supported Cryptocurrency (e.g., USDT) is released as soon as payment is confirmed. Yugdex does not take custody or facilitate transfer of the fiat currency funds in this model, and the transfer of the fiat currency funds is solely between Users without any responsibility or liability of Yugdex in this connection. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you hereby grant Yugdex the right to resolve issues and disputes among Users in its sole discretion. 
                </p>
                <p> <strong> 5.5 Trading between Supported Cryptocurrencies. </strong>  Yugdex allows you to trade with other Users between various Supported Cryptocurrencies (e.g., BTC-ETH, BTC-LTC etc.). 
                </p>
                <p> <strong> 5.6 Sharing User Information. </strong>  In the course of processing a Wallet Transactions, Yugdex may be required to share your user information with other contractual third parties, or as required under applicable laws or demanded upon a lawful request by any governmental authority. You hereby irrevocably grant full permission and authority for Yugdex to share this information with such contractual third parties, or as required under applicable laws or demanded upon a lawful request by any governmental authority, and release Yugdex from any liability, error, mistake, or negligence related thereto. 
                </p>
                <p> <strong> 5.7 Trade Corrections. </strong>  You acknowledge and agree that Yugdex may correct, reverse or cancel, in its sole discretion, any order, trade, transfer, or other transaction or activity with respect to which Yugdex has discovered that there was an error or abnormality, whether such error or abnormality was caused by you, Yugdex or a third party or due to technical issues, system issues, software failure or otherwise. Yugdex provides no guarantee or warranty that any such attempt will be successful and will have no responsibility or liability for such error(s) or any correction attempt(s).

                <h5> 6. THE YUGDEX PAIRS (OFFERED AND OPERATED BY ATTOL)  </h5>
                
                <p> Yugdex enables Users to trade with each other in trading pairs and use balances which are denominated notionally in Indian Rupees only for convenience in order to enable Users to calculate the value of the relevant Supported Cryptocurrency being traded (“Yugdex Pairs”). Any reference to Indian Rupees or INR on Yugdex should not be construed as a reference to Indian Rupees amounting to legal tender (otherwise referred to as ‘fiat currency’ or ‘real money’) unless specifically provided herein. 
                </p>
                <p> While P2P transactions are offered and operated by Binance (as described above), non-P2P transactions are offered and operated by Attol. 
                Terms applicable to Indian Resident Users for Yugdex Pairs 
                </p>
                <p> In non-P2P transactions, Users resident in India (as defined under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999) add to their INR balance by depositing Indian Rupees from their registered bank account / payment instrument to Attol’s or its partners’ bank account using regulated banking and payment channels, and can redeem their INR balance to their bank accounts / payment instrument by placing a withdrawal request to Attol, upon which request Attol will transfer the INR balance amount to the Users’ registered bank account / payment instrument, using regulated banking and payment channels, subject to Know Your Customer and other safeguards carried out in Attol’s sole discretion, and subject to withdrawal limits published on the website / mobile application from time to time. In this model, Attol merely acts as a duly appointed agent of the User to whom the payment is due, and does not operate a payment system. You hereby duly appoint Attol as your agent for this purpose. 
                Terms applicable to Non-Indian Resident Users for Yugdex Pairs 
                </p>
                <p> In all circumstances, Users not resident in India (as defined under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999) (“Foreign Users”) can use limited features of the Services. Foreign Users cannot in any circumstance receive or make payments in Indian Rupees or equivalents or any other fiat currency or equivalents (otherwise referred to as ‘real money’ or ‘fiat currency’). Foreign Users can only use the Services to trade between Supported Cryptocurrencies without any interface to fiat currency. Foreign Users are not entitled to redeem any INR balance with Yugdex for Indian Rupees (unlike Users resident in India who may withdraw their INR balance to their bank accounts) or any other fiat currency. The INR balance of a Foreign User is only denoted on the platform for convenience and can only be used by a Foreign User to further trade in Supported Cryptocurrencies. Foreign Users do not therefore carry out any transactions in fiat currency using the Services and merely hold Supported Cryptocurrencies in their Yugdex wallets and trade between Supported Cryptocurrencies. 
                This Clause 6 applies mutatis mutandis to the Yugdex Pairs offered on Binance.com and all Binance desktop and mobile applications.

                <h5> 13. GENERAL  </h5>
                
                <p>   <strong> 13.1 Dispute Resolution.  </strong> Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Yugdex and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>
                (a) Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be settled by arbitration as follows: 
                </li>
                <li> 
                (i) In the case of disputes, controversies or claims involving Binance: You and Binance agree to resolve any claims relating to this Agreement (including any question regarding their existence, validity, termination, or any services or products provided and any representations made by us) through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below. You agree to first give us an opportunity to resolve any claims by contacting us on our website / mobile / desktop applications. If we are not able to resolve your claims within 60 days of receiving the notice, you may seek relief through arbitration or in the Small Claims Tribunals of Singapore (“SCT”), as set forth below. 
                Either you or Binance may submit a dispute (after having made good faith efforts to resolve such dispute) for final and binding resolution by arbitration under the arbitration rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”), which are deemed to be incorporated into these Terms by reference. The arbitration tribunal shall consist of a sole arbitrator to be appointed by the President of SIAC. The language of the arbitration hearings shall be English and the seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be Singapore. JUDGMENT ON ANY ARBITRAL AWARD MAY BE GIVEN IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTY (OR OVER THE ASSETS OF THE PARTY) AGAINST WHOM SUCH AN AWARD IS RENDERED. 
                Exceptions. Either party may instead choose to assert the claims in the SCT if the claims fall within the jurisdiction of the SCT, and either party may seek injunctive relief or other urgent equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. However, for the avoidance of doubt, where the claims fall outside of the jurisdiction of the SCT, the claims will be referred to and finally resolved by SIAC arbitration. 
                </li>
                <li> 
                (ii) In the case of disputes, controversies or claims involving Attol, you and Attol agree to resolve any claims relating to this Agreement (including any question regarding their existence, validity, termination, or any services or products provided and any representations made by us) through final and binding arbitration. You agree to first give us an opportunity to resolve any claims by contacting us on our website / mobile / desktop applications. If we are not able to resolve your claims within 60 days of receiving the notice, you may seek relief through arbitration as set forth below. 
                Either you or Attol may submit a dispute (after having made good faith efforts to resolve such dispute) for final and binding resolution by arbitration under the arbitration rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”), which are deemed to be incorporated into these Terms by reference, read with the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The arbitration tribunal shall consist of a sole arbitrator to be appointed by the President of SIAC. The language of the arbitration hearings shall be English and the seat of arbitration shall be Singapore. 
                </li>
                <li> 
                (b) Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, as applicable, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Yugdex in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND YUGDEX WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. 
                </li>
                <li> 
                (c) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. 
                </li>
                <li> 
                (d) Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief. 
                </li>
                <li> 
                (e) Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. 
                </li>
                <li> 
                (f) Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement. 
                </li>
                <li> 
                (g) Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Yugdex. 
                </li>
                <li> 
                (h) Emergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a court of competent jurisdiction in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement. 
                </li>
                <li>    
                (i) Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement. 
                </li>
                </ul>

                <p>  <strong>  13.2 Applicable Law.  </strong> The laws of India excluding its choice of law provisions, will govern these Terms and any dispute that arises between you and Attol. 
                </p>
                <p>  <strong>  13.3 Force Majeure.  </strong> Yugdex is not responsible for damages caused by delay or failure to perform undertakings under this Agreement when the delay or failure is due to fires; strikes; floods; power outages or failures; acts of God or the state’s enemies; lawful acts of public authorities; any and all market movements, shifts, or volatility; computer, server, or Internet malfunctions; security breaches or cyberattacks; criminal acts; delays or defaults caused by common carriers; acts or omissions of third parties; or, any other delays, defaults, failures or interruptions that cannot reasonably be foreseen or provided against. In the event of force majeure, Yugdex is excused from any and all performance obligations and this Agreement shall be fully and conclusively at an end. 
                </p>
                <p>  <strong>  13.4 Electronic Communications.  </strong> The communications between you and Yugdex use electronic means, whether you use the Site or send us emails, or whether Yugdex posts notices on the Site or communicates with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from Yugdex in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Yugdex provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were be in a hardcopy writing. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights. 
                </p>
                <p>  <strong>  13.5 Entire Agreement.  </strong> This Agreement, together with Yugdex’s Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Services. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation”. If any provision of this Agreement is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to Yugdex is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. This Agreement, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Yugdex’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Yugdex may freely assign this Agreement. The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall be binding upon assignees.
                </p>
